# Lost Treasure
This game is similar to that of treasure hunt. We will take certain area into consideration and make them into blocks mainly 10x10.Players earn points when ever they reach the set location which is also called as "Destination".Each player can create a team and can play together.They can also enter into a competition and can compete with each other.

# RFP-HUNT GAME

Statement of Purpose
2020 has turned out to be an interesting year. We would like to create an outside, socially-distant game that:

Encourages outside activity.
Introduces Bearcats to unique and special parts of campus.
Supports teamwork, while allowing players to remain safe.
Could be an engaging icebreaker for various student organizations.
Vision
We would like to create an app that can be played on a mobile device. The app would encourage players to complete a 'quest' by encountering a specific list of locations. A player would activate one of the locations in the quest. To score that location, the user must enter the geographic area (as determined by their mobile device). Locations may be explicitly identified (easier) - or described using clues (harder). The quest may require locations to be accessed in a specific order - or in any order as specified by the quest creator.

Points may be earned for:

a player reaching a location
a player completing a quest
Points for each location may be assigned based on the estimated difficulty.

Points for a completed quest may be based on the sum of the location points earned along with a possible bonus based on locating all points (a completion bonus) - and/or based on the time to complete the quest as specified by the quest creator.

Once created, a quest can be opened up again for different teams or people. Each instance of a quest should be associated with:

A start and end datetime.
A set of participating teams.
Functional Requirements
Create a progressive web app (or native application) with authentication and authorization. The following roles are suggested:

#### Administrator (access to all information including app settings)
User (access to their content)
Any user may choose to:

Create and manage a team (serve as captain)
Create and manage a quest (serve as quest creator)
Launch a competition (serve as hunt master)
Join a team and participate in a quest (serve as a player)
Any user can choose to create a team.

The user serves as captain of any team they create.
The captain provides a team name.
The captain provides a list of emails of invited members.
A user can accept the team invite and become a team player or reject it.
After three days, if not accepted, assume rejection.
Any user can choose to design a quest.

The user serves as designer of any quest they create.
The designer provides a quest name.
The designer provides a list of locations for the quest.
For each location, the designer provides a location number.
For each location, the designer provides location coordinates (either by entering numbers OR based on a 10' x 10' square around their current location)
Any user can choose to launch a competion.

The user serves as the hunt master of the competion.
The hunt master specifies the start date and time for the competion.
The hunt master specifies the end date and time for the competion.
The hunt master chooses an existing quest for the competion.
The hunt master invites a list of teams to compete about a week before.
Each team captain can accept or reject the invitation.
By 24 hours before the competition, if not accepted, assume rejection.
Security must be addressed throughout the app.

The app must be able to access geospatial information from the device, using either native senors or browser information.

The app should provide visible and audible feedback for the player when the active location is encountered.

The app should provide visible and audible feedback for the player when the active quest is completed.

The app should be responsive, able to work well on various mobile devices from phones to laptops and tablets in various orientations.

The app should provide a customizable theme using NW Bearcat colors. This them should be able to be swapped if the app is used at other schools.

## The app must work on:

an iPhone SE
an Android device
a laptop computer
an iPad

Bidder Qualifications
Teams that bid on the RFP must be able to:

###### Specify the project.
Discuss and clarify details with our acting client before beginning.
Implement functionality within times agreed to in the contract.
Use professional tools for collaboration.
Use professional tools for project management and tracking.
Communicate professionally in person (as the environment allows).
Communicate professionally remotely (as the situation requires).
Performance Metrics
Teams will be judged on their performance to meet the proposed contract deliverables.

##### Schedule (Duration in Weeks)
Module 1: Rapid architecture/data/UI design & proposal competition (~2)
Module 2: Synthesis of design and initial planning (~2)
Module 3-6: Implementation iterations
Module 7: Early release and contract finalization (~1)
Project Conception and Initialization
Module 1 will include the rapid development of a proposal to be presented in Markdown or HTML with in-line images and tables (not Word).

This is quick - occuring at the very beginning of the semester.

This forces hard decisions about entities, screens, and functionality. Good effort this this phase will make the rest of the project much more effective.

The proposal should include the following sections.

Statement of Purpose
Overview
Benefits
Epics / User Stories / Tasks
Acceptance criteria checklist
Contract scope / budget / schedule (2 semesters)
User interface sketches (e.g. Figma or paper)
Technology stack descriptions
E-R diagram displayed and described
Consistent set of sample data in Excel, use one sheet for each entity
Risks and assumptions
Module 1 teams will be assigned at random for this initial design competiion.

These teams will be disbanded at the end of Module 1.

Module 1 is a friendly competition. The teams and client will work together to choose the best parts of each proposal and use this to direct the remaining effort.

Project Definition and Planning
Based on the information learned from all teams rapid response in Module 1, we will reorganize and begin a clear, consolidated design vision in Module 2.

Module 2 will include the development of a detailed contract for this semester's remaining work. Here is where we decide exactly what products will be created and what platforms or technology stacks will be used for each instance.

Designs and plans will be presented in Markdown or HTML with in-line images and tables (not Word).

We recommend different teams try different data stores, architecture approaches (e.g.microservices), and frameworks (e.g. Vue or Vanilla JavaScript custom components).

Getting data and user interface correct FIRST are critical.

NO WORK MAY begin on any UI until the client and mentor have signed a sketch.

The contract will specify:

Purpose
Overview
Benefits
Epics / User Stories / Tasks
Acceptance criteria checklist
Functional requirements
Performance requirements (within range of values)
Other requirements
User interface sketches (e.g. Figma or paper)
E-R diagram
Sample data
Stack description (including expected tools, technologies, libraries, more)
Risks and assumptions
Deliverable artifacts
Scope
Milestones
Schedule and Iteration Plan
Budget
Test plan with requirements
Bid amount
Payment, Incentives, and Containment
If contract requirements are met 1 7-day week ahead of schedule to the satisfaction of the client, students are eligible for a 2.5% bonus (based on the total points possible) for the associated deliverable.

Terms and Conditions
Code and applications should be open-source and licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

Evaluation Criteria
The client will provide feedback throughout the development process.

While the client may ask for a requirement change, if granted it would require a modification of the contract with commensurate elimination of other requirements.

This would only be applied it there was a critical change in core functionality.

Typically, requirements changes will be documented and would serve as the basis of a change contract.

The user interface will be evaluated on aesthetics as well as ability to perform a task.
There will be a single major review of every new interface screen.
Good choices will be made for images/color/sound.
Screen space will be used well.
Controls will have signifiers indicating where and how operations/input can occur.
Input will be validated.
Appropriate feedback will be employed.
The interface will avoid requiring multiple clicks for common operations.
Confirmation is not required if an operation is easy to undo.
Confirmation is required for operations that cannot be undone.
Default values will be provided for fields.
Do not loose what has been typed if there are errors.
The app will be ADA compliant.
If specified in the contract, support for internationalization may be required.
Note: Correct functionality is not a requirement change.
